# zkAuth


Crypto power users and degen try out tons of hot new dApps on a daily basis, however the concern of revealing wallet activities to an untrusted party results in a high friction experience to manage multiple burner wallets while interacting with a new dApp for the first time.

zkAuth is aimed to solve this problem. For new dApps to increase user trust and reduce friction during onboarding, they can enable users to sign-up with a zero-knowledge authentication solution that doesnâ€™t collect any user information when they are initially trying out the app.

zkAuth uses zk-SNARK and Plonk to prove the user owns the wallet / email without sharing the details. The protocol is deployed and run on both Polygon and Scroll alpha testnet.
